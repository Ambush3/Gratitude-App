# About the project
Gratitude App is an App I made where users can sign up, login, and upload  what you have gratitude for daily. 
You can also upload images for your post, which are uploaded to cloudinary.  

Currently working on:
1. Users can get an email that will send them a gratitude via email that they may have posted   
in the past
2. Users can select a date within the application, and see what post/grattitude comes up for that selected date.
